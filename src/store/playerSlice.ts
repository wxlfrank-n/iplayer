/**
 * Redux slice for player playback state.
 *
 * Holds everything the audio engine exposes as mutable state: the track list,
 * which track is current, live playback position, volume, and mute. The audio
 * element itself stays a side effect inside `useAudioPlayer`; this slice is the
 * single source of truth that all components read.
